# Custom Nodes

We may customize the platform to our needs and easily add our own nodes using well defined patterns:
```ts
const customNode = {
  name: 'My Business Processor',
  inputs: ['ideas'],
  outputs: ['unicorns'],
  
  async *run({ input, output }) {
    // logic goes here ğŸ§ 
  },
};
```

Make derived and nested diagrams. A diagram is a node and a node is a diagram ğŸ¤¯
```ts
const Contacts = deriveFrom(BaseEntity, { ... }
```
