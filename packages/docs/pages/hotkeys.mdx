# Hotkeys Reference Guide

This document provides an overview of the keyboard shortcuts (hotkeys) available in the application, detailing their functions and the corresponding actions they trigger.

## Available Hotkeys

### General Actions

- **Shift + R**: Runs the current diagram.

- **Shift + Minus (-)**: Opens the Add Node sidebar.

- **Shift + T**: Quickly adds a Table node to the diagram.

### Operations

- **Ctrl + S / Cmd + S**: Performs the save operation. When an `onSave` callback is provided, pressing this shortcut will execute the save action, with the default behavior in the [playground](/playground) being to save to localStorage.

### Node Operations

- **Enter**: Opens Node Settings Sidebar. When a node is selected, and only one node is selected, pressing this key will open the settings sidebar for that node.
