### Packages summary
* core - the computation part 🧠
* ui - the react component 📦
* docs - this website 📚

### Development Installation
```bash
yarn
```

Then, to work on all packages, setup these commands to all run simultaneously:

```bash
# in root
yarn dev
```


### Monorepo installation 🆘
> HELP WANTED

Instead of the above cumbersome 7+ terminal setup we would like to be able to work on everything from root like this:
```
yarn
yarn dev
```

There are some  `turbo.json` config prepared but its not really working.
