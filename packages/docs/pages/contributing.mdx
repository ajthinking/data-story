## Development Installation
```
yarn set version berry
yarn
yarn dev
```
This will allow you to work on all packages simultaneously.

Alternatively you may install per package, but this will require quite a few terminals.

```
# in root
yarn set version berry
yarn
npx nodemon -x "npx @data-story/core server"

# in core
yarn tsc --watch
npx webpack --watch

# in ui
yarn tsc --watch
yarn watch:css
npx webpack --watch

# in client

```
