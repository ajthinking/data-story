import { DataStory } from "@data-story/ui"

# Visualize
DataStory does not include any *visualization* components other than `Table` node. We may also use the `ConsoleLog` node to dump items. However, you may use Observers to pass item data to some third party component.


## Demo

import VisualizeDemo from '../components/demos/VisualizeDemo';

<VisualizeDemo />
